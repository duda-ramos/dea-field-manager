## üîê Fix #1: Storage Credentials Encryption (CRITICAL)

### Problem
Credentials in `storage_integrations.config` were stored in **plaintext JSONB**, exposing:
- OAuth tokens
- API keys
- S3/Cloud storage credentials

**Impact:** Full compromise of external accounts if database is breached.

### Solution
- ‚úÖ Added `config_encrypted_data` column with AES-256 encryption
- ‚úÖ Created encryption/decryption functions using `pgcrypto`
- ‚úÖ Implemented secure view `storage_integrations_decrypted` for authorized access
- ‚úÖ Added migration function for existing data

### Required Actions

#### 1. Generate a Strong Encryption Key
```bash
# Generate a 256-bit encryption key
openssl rand -base64 32
```

#### 2. Configure the Key in Supabase
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor or via CLI
ALTER DATABASE postgres SET app.storage_encryption_key = 'YOUR_GENERATED_KEY_HERE';
```

**IMPORTANT:** Store this key in:
- ‚úÖ Supabase Vault (recommended)
- ‚úÖ Environment variables (backup)
- ‚úÖ Secure password manager
- ‚ùå **NEVER** commit to git

#### 3. Migrate Existing Data
```sql
-- Run this AFTER setting the encryption key
SELECT migrate_storage_configs_to_encrypted();
```

Expected output:
```
NOTICE:  Successfully encrypted N storage integration configs
```

#### 4. Update Application Code
**Before:**
```typescript
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('storage_integrations')
  .select('config');
```

**After:**
```typescript
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('storage_integrations_decrypted')
  .select('config');
// Config is automatically decrypted for authorized users
```

#### 5. Verify Encryption
```sql
-- Check encryption status
SELECT * FROM security_audit_summary 
WHERE table_name = 'storage_integrations';

-- Should show: unencrypted_count = 0
```

## üîí Fix #2-4: Audit Log Immutability (CRITICAL)

### Problem
Audit tables had RLS policies with `WITH CHECK (true)`, allowing:
- ‚úÖ Authenticated users to INSERT fake audit entries
- ‚úÖ Attackers to cover their tracks
- ‚úÖ Falsification of security history

**Tables affected:**
- `project_audit_logs`
- `api_key_audit_logs`
- `storage_integration_audit`
- `contact_access_logs`

### Solution
‚úÖ **New RLS Policies:**
```sql
-- Only allow inserts from database triggers
CREATE POLICY "Only database triggers can insert"
  ON audit_table FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (pg_trigger_depth() > 0);

-- Prevent updates and deletes entirely
CREATE POLICY "Audit logs are immutable"
  ON audit_table FOR UPDATE/DELETE
  USING (false);
```

### Verification

#### Test 1: Attempt Manual Insert (Should Fail)
```sql
-- This should fail with RLS error
INSERT INTO project_audit_logs (project_id, user_id, action)
VALUES ('some-uuid', auth.uid(), 'FAKE_ACTION');

-- Expected: new row violates row-level security policy
```

#### Test 2: Verify Trigger Inserts Work
```sql
-- Create a test project (should auto-create audit log)
INSERT INTO projects (name, user_id) VALUES ('Test', auth.uid());

-- Check audit log was created
SELECT * FROM project_audit_logs 
WHERE action = 'INSERT' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;

-- Should show the insert
```

#### Test 3: Attempt Update/Delete (Should Fail)
```sql
-- Both should fail
UPDATE project_audit_logs SET action = 'MODIFIED' WHERE id = 'some-id';
DELETE FROM contact_access_logs WHERE id = 'some-id';

-- Expected: new row violates row-level security policy
```

## üë• Fix #5: Contact Data Access Security

### Problem
Potential issues with `user_can_access_project_contacts_secure` function allowing unintended access.

### Solution
‚úÖ **Enhanced Security:**
- Hardened RLS policies with trigger-depth checks
- Added data classification constraints
- Implemented session tracking in audit logs
- Created `validate_contact_access_secure()` function

### Verification
```sql
-- Check contact access validation
SELECT validate_contact_access_secure(
  'contact-uuid',
  'view'
);
-- Should return true only for owners/admins
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Fix #6-7: Configuration Recommendations

### Issue 6: Leaked Password Protection

**Action Required:**
```sql
-- Enable in Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > Settings
ALTER DATABASE postgres SET statement_timeout = '30s';
```

Or via Supabase Dashboard:
1. Go to **Authentication** ‚Üí **Policies**
2. Enable "**Check for leaked passwords**"
3. Set threshold to "Low" or "Medium"

### Issue 7: PostgreSQL Updates

**Check Version:**
```sql
SELECT version();
```

**Upgrade Path:**
1. Supabase projects auto-update during maintenance windows
2. For self-hosted: Follow [Supabase upgrade guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/migrating-and-upgrading-projects)
3. Schedule maintenance window
4. Enable auto-updates in dashboard

## üîÑ Fix #8-12: Missing Updated_at Triggers

### Tables Fixed
‚úÖ `project_collaborators`  
‚úÖ `project_templates`  
‚úÖ `project_activities`

### Verification
```sql
-- Check all tables have triggers
SELECT 
  t.tablename,
  COUNT(trg.tgname) as trigger_count
FROM pg_tables t
LEFT JOIN pg_trigger trg ON trg.tgrelid = t.tablename::regclass
WHERE t.schemaname = 'public'
  AND t.tablename LIKE '%project%'
GROUP BY t.tablename
ORDER BY trigger_count;
```

---

## üìä Ongoing Security Monitoring

### 1. Detect Suspicious Activity
```sql
-- Run daily or integrate with monitoring
SELECT * FROM detect_suspicious_audit_activity();
```

**Alert Types:**
- `rapid_contact_access`: >50 contacts in 5 minutes
- `unusual_storage_access`: >100 accesses in 1 hour
- `api_key_abuse`: >10 failed attempts in 15 minutes

### 2. Review Security Audit Summary
```sql
SELECT * FROM security_audit_summary;
```

### 3. Check Audit Log Integrity
```sql
-- Verify no manual inserts possible
SELECT 
  tablename,
  COUNT(*) as total_rows,
  MAX(created_at) as last_entry
FROM (
  SELECT 'project_audit_logs' as tablename, created_at FROM project_audit_logs
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'api_key_audit_logs', created_at FROM api_key_audit_logs
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'contact_access_logs', created_at FROM contact_access_logs
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'storage_integration_audit', created_at FROM storage_integration_audit
) combined
GROUP BY tablename;
```

## üîê Security Best Practices

### Encryption Key Management
- [ ] Store key in Supabase Vault (production)
- [ ] Rotate key every 90 days
- [ ] Use different keys for dev/staging/prod
- [ ] Implement key rotation procedure

### Audit Log Retention
- Default: 90 days (via `cleanup_old_audit_logs()`)
- Adjust in migration if needed:
```sql
-- Modify retention period
ALTER FUNCTION cleanup_old_audit_logs() ...
-- Change: INTERVAL '90 days' ‚Üí INTERVAL '365 days'
```

### Access Control Review
- [ ] Review RLS policies monthly
- [ ] Audit user permissions quarterly
- [ ] Monitor failed access attempts
- [ ] Implement automated alerts

## üìã Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Review migration in staging environment
- [ ] Generate and securely store encryption key
- [ ] Schedule maintenance window
- [ ] Notify team of changes

### Deployment
- [ ] Apply migration via Supabase CLI or dashboard
- [ ] Configure encryption key in database
- [ ] Run `migrate_storage_configs_to_encrypted()`
- [ ] Verify all tests pass

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Verify encryption status (see Fix #1, step 5)
- [ ] Test audit log immutability (see Fix #2-4)
- [ ] Update application code for decrypted view
- [ ] Monitor for errors in application logs
- [ ] Run security audit summary

### Rollback Plan
```sql
-- If issues occur, encryption can be temporarily disabled:
ALTER TABLE storage_integrations 
  ALTER COLUMN config_encrypted SET DEFAULT false;

-- Audit log policies SHOULD NOT be rolled back
-- They prevent security vulnerabilities
```

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Error: "Encryption key not configured"
**Solution:**
```sql
ALTER DATABASE postgres SET app.storage_encryption_key = 'your-key';
```

### Error: "Failed to decrypt storage configuration"
**Cause:** Key mismatch or corrupted data  
**Solution:**
1. Verify correct key is set
2. Check encryption_version column
3. Re-run migration for affected rows

### Error: "new row violates row-level security policy" on audit insert
**Expected behavior** - This means the security fix is working!  
Verify inserts happen via triggers only.

### Application errors after deployment
**Common causes:**
1. Code still using `storage_integrations` instead of `storage_integrations_decrypted`
2. Missing RLS permissions
3. Encryption key not propagated to all workers
