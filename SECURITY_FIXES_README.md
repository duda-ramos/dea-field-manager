If you just want to fix everything right now:

```bash
# 1. Apply migration
cd /workspace && supabase db push

# 2. Generate and set encryption key
openssl rand -base64 32
# Copy output, then in Supabase SQL Editor:
# ALTER DATABASE postgres SET app.storage_encryption_key = 'YOUR_KEY';

# 3. Encrypt existing data
# In Supabase SQL Editor:
# SELECT migrate_storage_configs_to_encrypted();

# 4. Update code
# Replace: .from('storage_integrations')
# With:    .from('storage_integrations_decrypted')

# 5. Deploy!
```
