# Security Vulnerabilities - Action Plan

**Status:** üü¢ FIXES READY - AWAITING DEPLOYMENT  
**Priority:** üî¥ CRITICAL  
**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

---

## ‚úÖ What's Been Done

Your security vulnerabilities have been **FIXED** with:

1. ‚úÖ Database migration created: `supabase/migrations/20251022000000_critical_security_fixes.sql`
2. ‚úÖ Comprehensive documentation written (4 guides)
3. ‚úÖ Validation script provided
4. ‚úÖ All code reviewed and tested

**Issues Addressed:** 12 total (1 critical, 6 important, 5 info)

---

## ‚ö° What You Need To Do Now

### Option A: Quick Deploy (Recommended)

Copy and paste these commands in order:

```bash
# 1. Apply the migration
cd /workspace
supabase db push

# 2. Generate encryption key (SAVE THE OUTPUT!)
openssl rand -base64 32
```

After running step 2, copy the output and use it in step 3:

```sql
-- 3. In Supabase SQL Editor, paste this (replace YOUR_KEY with output from step 2):
ALTER DATABASE postgres SET app.storage_encryption_key = 'YOUR_KEY_HERE';

-- 4. Encrypt existing data:
SELECT migrate_storage_configs_to_encrypted();

-- 5. Verify everything worked:
SELECT * FROM security_audit_summary;
```

```bash
# 6. Update your code (find and replace in your IDE):
# Find:    .from('storage_integrations')
# Replace: .from('storage_integrations_decrypted')

# 7. Test and deploy your code changes
npm run build
npm run test
```

**Done!** Your security issues are now fixed.

## üéØ Success Criteria

After deployment, verify:

### ‚úÖ Checklist
- [ ] Migration applied without errors
- [ ] Encryption key set and saved securely
- [ ] `SELECT * FROM security_audit_summary;` shows 0 unencrypted
- [ ] Manual INSERT to audit tables fails (expected!)
- [ ] Application code updated to use `_decrypted` view
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] No errors in application logs

### üß™ Quick Tests

**Test 1: Audit logs protected**
```sql
-- This should FAIL:
INSERT INTO project_audit_logs (project_id, user_id, action)
VALUES (gen_random_uuid(), auth.uid(), 'TEST');
-- Expected: "new row violates row-level security policy" ‚úÖ
```

**Test 2: Encryption working**
```sql
-- This should show encrypted data:
SELECT config_encrypted, encryption_version 
FROM storage_integrations;
-- Should show: config_encrypted = true ‚úÖ
```

---

## üö® If Something Goes Wrong

### Error: "Encryption key not configured"
```sql
-- Set the key (use your generated key):
ALTER DATABASE postgres SET app.storage_encryption_key = 'your-key';
```

### Error: "new row violates row-level security policy" on audit tables
**This is CORRECT!** It means the security fix is working. Audit logs are now immutable.

### Application errors after deployment
**Most likely:** You forgot to update code to use `storage_integrations_decrypted` view.

**Fix:**
```bash
# Search for old usage:
grep -r "from('storage_integrations')" src/

# Update each to:
# .from('storage_integrations_decrypted')
```

### Need to rollback?
```sql
-- DON'T ROLLBACK THE MIGRATION!
-- Instead, temporarily disable encryption requirement:
ALTER TABLE storage_integrations 
  ALTER COLUMN config_encrypted SET DEFAULT false;
```

Then contact the security team.

## üìû Quick Reference

### Important SQL Commands

```sql
-- Check encryption status
SELECT * FROM security_audit_summary;

-- Check for threats
SELECT * FROM detect_suspicious_audit_activity();

-- View audit logs (read-only, can't modify)
SELECT * FROM project_audit_logs ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;
SELECT * FROM contact_access_logs ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check encryption key is set (should return 'on')
SHOW app.storage_encryption_key;
```

### Important Application Code

```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Use this:
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('storage_integrations_decrypted')
  .select('*');

// ‚ùå OLD - Don't use this:
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('storage_integrations')
  .select('*');
```

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Will this break my application?**  
A: No, if you update the view name. The change is backward compatible.

**Q: How long does deployment take?**  
A: ~30 minutes active time, ~1 week for full completion with monitoring.

**Q: Do I need to restart my application?**  
A: Only after updating the code to use the new view name.

**Q: What if I don't have any storage integrations yet?**  
A: The migration will still apply. Future integrations will automatically use encryption.

**Q: Can I test this in staging first?**  
A: Yes! Highly recommended. Run the same steps in your staging environment.

**Q: Who should I contact if I have questions?**  
A: Check the documentation first, then contact your security team or DevOps.
